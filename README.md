# Summer-project-on-time-dependent-infectivity-and-detectability

The result is summarized in 3 different jupyter notebook files. two of which concerning the change in infectibility with time, and one concerning change in detectability. 

The jupyter notebook "approximating logit" outlines the method inwhich logistic disease progression can be approximated with multiple box model, and show that an different set of parameter can be fitted from the epidemic thus generated to create an simpler SEI model
where the prediction is not visually different from the actual, more complex model.

The note book titled "forward fitting approach
